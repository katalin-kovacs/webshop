This is an Angular 18 training project, with the aim of exploring the new features in Angular 18 and Material 18. Keeping unit testing, code quality, and best practices as a focus, with extra attention to accessibility and performance. Later on, I plan to add an Express.js backend to make it a full-stack application.

## Planned Pages And Features

- **Landing Page:** navigation, search, hero section, product carousel, ratings, and some SEO section
- **Product List:** filtering, search, pagination, card display, add to wishlist
- **Product Details:** images, description, price, add to cart, add to wishlist
- **Cart:** list products, modify quantity, remove items
- **Checkout:** form, validation, summary
- **User Account:** registration, login, profile, wishlist
- **Admin:** product management

## Planned Technical Features

- Standalone components
- State management with signals and NgRx store (e.g., cart, product list, filters)
- Material 3 theming API, light/dark mode, design tokens
- Accessibility: color contrast, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, proper heading hierarchy
